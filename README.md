# Lunar Lander
#### By Logan Jones

This is adapted from a project I did for my master's degree in the GA Tech OMSCS program.


## Installation
You should be able to install all the dependencies by (creating a virtual environment) 
and then running the following command:

```shell script
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
