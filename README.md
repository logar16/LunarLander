# Lunar Lander
#### By Logan Jones

This is adapted from a project I did for my master's degree in the GA Tech OMSCS program.


## Installation
You should be able to install all the dependencies by (creating a virtual environment) 
and then running the following command:

```shell script
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
``` 

If installing Box2D (for the gym env) gives you issues and you are on Windows,
check out [this article](https://medium.com/@sayanmndl21/install-openai-gym-with-box2d-and-mujoco-in-windows-10-e25ee9b5c1d5).


## Training

You will need the following directories to be present or errors will be thrown
* `figures/`
* `models/`
